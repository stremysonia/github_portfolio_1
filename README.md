## INTERIOR DESIGN

This Interior Design web page was the first project that was created for a ten week Full Stack Development program at Wyncode Academy.

CSS flexbox - direction was used to organize the photographs in these columns. Two text boxes were placed on top of the images using CSS opacity so that the images could be seen and the text could be read.
